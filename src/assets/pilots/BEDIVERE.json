He also has not forgotten his past as a Loyal Wing, as he still works quite well in group situations. However, due to the circumstances, Quartz has developed a bit of a habit of going off on his own.\n- However, when he is in combat or a tough situation, Quartz is rather steeled. He may be tender-hearted but he harbors no qualms about killing, especially if it’s got anything to do with Harrison Armory.\n\n- one thing has nagged at him constantly since hearing about the protocol. it's the feasibility of the whole situation. you don't doubt that the Standard had enough firepower, that unleashing their salvo would destroy the makteba. the question is, why did the makteba let itself be hit? it's never happened in your lifetime, at least not for your makteba, but they are capable of movement. the albatross exist at light speed and have had a long time to perfect their technology. it's not practical and it's not cheap, but the infrastructure is there for the makteba, the moon itself, to travel at near-light speed. so why didn't it escape? was it pride, inability, or something else?\n- as you've wandered the ruins, you've seen countless Last Standard cargo vessels, vultures picking the remains of the corpse. you've attacked them where you can, but sometimes the numbers are just too much. at the centre of the impact crater, you know that something is being built. but the walls have been built tall and strong, and your wing is still broken.","history":"<p><em>\"BEDIVERE, in ancient Cradle legend, was one of the sole survivors of that gruesome battle, where hero-king and usurper alike were slain.

Then, maybe one day, the ones you are waiting for will return.\"</em></p><hr><p></p><p>Recently on Ras Nova, rumors have been spreading about a strange mech with an unidentified Lancer in its cockpit, the ghost of an Albatross lost to time. Few have been able to communicate with him successfully. Contact with The Last Standard has been extremely violent; however, contact with The Aftermath has always been simply ignored. The ghost has most often been spotted around ruins of the fallen moon, but what the ghost does there is unknown to all parties.</p><p>This ghost is Quartz Albas, known by the callsign Bedivere.</p><p>Quartz was a Loyal Wing, an Albatross of high renown: the moon that fell upon Ras Nova was his detachment's Makteba. He was one of the youngest Petrels in history to graduate to a Loyal Wing, at least in his Makteba. On the last mission he was on, he was fatally wounded protecting the Petrels under his wing. His detachment, wherever they found themselves in the universe, decided to send him back to their Makteba as an attempt to save him, as the detachment did not have the specialized equipment nor the proper mechanics to keep him stable.</p><p>Quartz awoke from hazy stasis confused. Where was he? Where were his comrades? Did his cadets make it out safely? The answers he got were strange and alarming: that he was on the planet Ras Nova, once known as Ark IV-Φ. His detachment was now so distant, the chances of him ever reuniting with them were close to null. Whatever allies he had on his Makteba were now few and far between, as the moon that held the Makteba had been destroyed by The Last Standard's Thousand-Arrow Protocol just a month before he descended upon Ras Nova.</p><p>For some time, Quartz was hidden from both The Aftermath and The Last Standard, as he got his bearings back. His rescuers were descendants of retired Albatross that descended onto the planet, and their connections allowed them to quietly nurse Quartz back up and provide him while hiding his identity and equipment. However, Quartz departed not long after he was able to move.</p><p>After all, it was The Last Standard that destroyed his home, and <strong>the Albatross will not go unavenged</strong>.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><em>O sorrowful seabird with severed wing, displaced and lost,</em></p><p><em>No nest to return to, nor kin to welcome you home.</em></p><p><em>Let wrath strengthen you, as you wage war on the endless storm.</em></p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":7,"background":"Albatross","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"2a2d405a-2fbf-452a-b837-fc0603aecef5","name":"Si Vis Pacem","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_raleigh","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":15,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":6,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Fri Apr 04 2025 18:52:37 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"966821d1-e49a-448b-9501-4f3dac945bc3","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_roland_chamber","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Packed into sealed, self-contained cylinders, IPS-N’s “Roland Rounds” are high-explosive anti-armor charges built for kinetic weapons of any mech-scale caliber.
