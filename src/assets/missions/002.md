## Reach for the Sky

*"Get a different perspective.”*  


# Goals

- Take control of the relay tower long enough for Aftermath to access it.
- Ascend to the satellite and install a backdoor for Aftermath access.
- ???

# Stakes

- The ability for Aftermath to coordinate the resistance
- Establishing contact off of Ark

---

> Communication on Ark has been limited ever since The Last Standard took control. Terminal Gerin hosts one of the seven relay beacons on the ground, capable of contacting other cities. Taking this facility would help re-establish Aftermath communications across the planet, though not without also hacking into the geo-locked satellite in low orbit above Gerin. Luckily, Aftermath has been preparing for such a flight.
