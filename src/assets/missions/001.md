> Ark-IV-Φ is a planet on the outskirts of Union Space, controlled by Harrison Armory. Purported as a dead planet after an accident caused the moon to fall, it has been believed to be inhabitable for the past cycle. In reality, new leadership has taken up arms on the planet's sub-surface, working towards an unknown goal.
