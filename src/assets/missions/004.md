> The crash site of the Makteba has been a constant source of activity from The Last Standard. Due to the frequency of patrols and convoys, Aftermath has been forced to operate with very little insight into what's happening at the site of the impact. The Makteba was host to a multitude of advanced technologies and materials that could be put towards Aftermath goals, potentially including records of their last moments before the Thousand Arrow Protocol. If such information were found, Aftermath could ebtter prepare for another salvo, or perhaps even stop the next.
