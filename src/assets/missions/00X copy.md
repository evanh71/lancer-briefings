> Arena fights are not an uncommon sight on Ark, as people fight for freedom. They were seemingly stopped after The Last Standard took over, but the Spec Ops division of The Last Standard's forces have been seen setting a perimeter around Terminal Gerin's Colosseum. Something is going on in there that they don't want seen. In addition, taking out Terminal Gerin's Spec Ops division could leave the local forces significantly weakened.
